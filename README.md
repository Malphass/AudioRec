# Welcome to this project to help train your voice

This app is made to help you train your voice in a simple way

1. The first line is to set the file, put the complete path of your file and the extensions like this -> C:\downloads\Sounds.mp3 .

2. When you have put your file you can start listening to it with the button above.

3. The file readed, you can start recording yourself with the rec button

4.  Then when you have finished you can listen to yourself with the Gramophone button.

Dont be afraid, I know it's really hard to train yourself and listen to your own voice but you deserve it and you are all beatifull and the best person ^^
